# Changelog

To get started with Uptrace, see https://uptrace.dev/get/get-started.html

## v1.2.0 - Unreleased

- Added 2 quick filters by `deployment.environment` and `service.name` attributes. More to come in
  the next release.

- Tweaked spans grouping and added 2 related options:

  - `project.group_by_env` - group spans by `deployment.environment` attribute.
  - `project.group_funcs_by_service` - group funcs spans by `service.name` attribute.

- Changed ClickHouse schema to not use column names with dots in them which causes issues with
  migrations, for example, such columns could not be renamed.

  If you have an existing ClickHouse database, you will have to reset it with:

```shell
uptrace ch reset
```

## v1.1.0 - Oct 1 2022

- Added additional ways to authenticate users via
  [Keycloak](https://uptrace.dev/get/auth-keycloak.html),
  [Google Cloud](https://uptrace.dev/get/auth-keycloak.html), and
  [Cloudflare](https://uptrace.dev/get/auth-cloudflare.html). Contributed by
  [@aramperes](https://github.com/aramperes).

- Added gauges support to Metrics UI. Only used in Redis Enterprise
  [example](example/redis-enterprise) for now.

- Renamed Logs tab to Events and moved all events there.

- Added support for PostgreSQL database instead of SQLite. This requires resetting SQLite database
  with:

```shell
uptrace db reset
```

- [Docker example](example/docker) is updated to work on Windows.
- Added [Redis Enterprise](example/redis-enterprise) example and metrics dashboards.

## v1.0.2 - Sep 8 2022
